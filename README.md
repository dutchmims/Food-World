### Project Overview

Foodworld is a food blog website which allows users explore blogs, recipes, stories and interact with a community of likeminded people. One can comment on a blog, add a recipe or leave information for other users to read and comment themselves. It’s the beginning of an online community of people who love food and want to delve into recipes, ideas or just leave details about their culinary experiences. If users want to share their own cooking tips or find tips, they can. It’s an open platform for users to share recipes, ideas, culinary experiences, to show off their own creations or maybe a stunning meal in a far off part of the world. The site is all about food, people, peoples love for food and how it evokes feelings and great memories. Comments can be posted by any registered users, but administration will review all and any comment to ensure proper standards and etiquette.

### User Stories/Goals

**Agile**

This was the first time I practiced agile in the development and planning of my project.
I created a list of user stories to assist in the development and implementation writing code and building the website. Each user story breaks up the project in to small chunks which can be tackled individually, eventually each on the back of the previous to build a complete working site. With each user story only a part of the site is worked on. With each user story completed, I moved on to the next and would then run in to bugs and errors which would require fixing before moving on.
