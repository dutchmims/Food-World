# Project Overview

Foodworld is a food blog website which allows users explore blogs, recipes, stories and interact with a community of likeminded people. One can comment on a blog, add a recipe or leave information for other users to read and comment themselves. It’s the beginning of an online community of people who love food and want to delve into recipes, ideas or just leave details about their culinary experiences. If users want to share their own cooking tips or find tips, they can. It’s an open platform for users to share recipes, ideas, culinary experiences, to show off their own creations or maybe a stunning meal in a far off part of the world. The site is all about food, people, peoples love for food and how it evokes feelings and great memories. Comments can be posted by any registered users, but administration will review all and any comment to ensure proper standards and etiquette.

# User Stories/Goals

**Agile**

This was the first time I practiced agile in the development and planning of my project.
I created a list of user stories to assist in the development and implementation writing code and building the website. Each user story breaks up the project in to small chunks which can be tackled individually, eventually each on the back of the previous to build a complete working site. With each user story only a part of the site is worked on. With each user story completed, I moved on to the next and would then run in to bugs and errors which would require fixing before moving on.

**Project Goals**

1. To create a website that is easy to navigate and use.
2. To create a website that is visually appealing.
3. To create a website that is responsive on all devices.
4. To create a website that is interactive.
5. To create a website that is fun to use.
6. To create a website that is easy to use.

**User goals**

1. I want to easily understand the product and whats being offered.
2. I want to understand the company and thier ethics.
3. I want to view comments.
4. I want to add a comment.
5. I want to like or unlike a post.
6. I want to view the website on all different media devices.
  
**Returning user goals**

1. I want to navigate quickly to get what I came for.
2. I want to be able to contact the company.
3. I want to know what other options are available.
4. I want to view comments.
5. I want to add a comment.
6. I want to like or unlike a post.
  
**Website owner goals**

1. I want to gain as many users as possible.
2. I want to create blog posts.
3. I want to leave details of recipes on a post
4. I want to provide as much information as possible to gain peoples interest in our service.

### CTA

The CTA button on the Homepage is a button that brings users down to the "latest Recipes". I used JavaScrpit here to add a scrolling effect once the CTA is clicked.

## Register

* I used the Django AllAuth for all the authentication on this blog site.  Django AllAut provides HTML pages for signing up and signing in and signing out. I have edited these HTML pages and styled them to show the same style, UX, font and colour palatte that I have chosen for my website as a whole.
